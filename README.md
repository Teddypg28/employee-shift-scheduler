This is a simple backtracking script implemented with python that takes in an array of employees with
their unavailable days to work and outputs a valid shift schedule.

The script ensures that each employee is scheduled to work twice a week and that no employee is scheduled
to work two shifts on the same day, while making sure that shifts are not scheduled on days/times in which employees
are unavailable.

Of course, this script can be modified with different contraints to handle a larger pool of employees.
